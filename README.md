# Assignement-1

Hello, welcome to my **Assignement 1**. This repository is just a class introduction to _Github_, _Git_, _Node_ and _Express_ but will probably contains <ins>our future project.</ins>

<ins>Now, you'll talk you about our project</ins>.
So, your project, simply called **Battleship**, will be an online battleship using Socket.io for handling Web Sockets and Stripe for Payment.
You'll also use Vue, Express, Sequelize ORM, and a lot of other lib. 

In this game, you'll be able to, of course, play a game of battleship, but also see your ranking over the world, buy some super missile, and have an account to keep your game and rewatch them when you want.
